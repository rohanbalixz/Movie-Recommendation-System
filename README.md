# Movie-Recommendation-System

To create a movie recommendation system using 5000 movies from TMDB (The Movie Database), you can follow these steps:

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Use the TMDB API to fetch movie data. You can use libraries like `requests` to make API calls.
   - Retrieve information such as movie title, overview, genre, and poster image URL.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean the data by handling missing values, formatting issues, and removing duplicates.
   - Extract features from the data that will be used for recommendation, such as movie genre, overview text, and possibly other metadata.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Convert text data (such as movie overview) into numerical representations using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
   - Encode categorical features like genres using one-hot encoding or embeddings.

4. **Similarity Calculation**:
   - Calculate similarity between movies based on the features you extracted.
   - Common methods for calculating similarity include cosine similarity, Pearson correlation, or Jaccard similarity.

5. **Building the Recommender System**:
   - Implement a recommendation algorithm, such as content-based filtering or collaborative filtering.
   - Content-based filtering recommends items similar to those the user liked in the past.
   - Collaborative filtering recommends items based on user behavior and preferences.
   - Hybrid approaches that combine content-based and collaborative filtering can also be effective.

6. **User Interface**:
   - Create a user interface where users can input their preferences and get recommendations.
   - You can use web frameworks like Streamlit or Flask for building the UI.
   - Display recommended movies along with their details such as title, poster image, and overview.

7. **Testing and Evaluation**:
   - Test the recommendation system with sample inputs and evaluate its performance.
   - Use metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy to assess how well the system performs in recommending relevant movies.

8. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the recommendation system so that users can access it.
   - You can deploy it on cloud platforms like Heroku or AWS, or use containerization tools like Docker for deployment.

Remember to handle API rate limits if you're making a large number of requests to the TMDB API. Additionally, ensure compliance with TMDB's terms of service when using their data and API.
